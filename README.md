# NR_Research-

The goal of the project was to develop algorithms for line failure identification on the electrical power grid. The project contains files that support line failure identificaiton. 

Most of the files in the folder are utility functions. The main script files of the project are: POWER_DATA_RESULTS_MLR
POWER_DATA_RESULTS_N4SID.m, Residual_Contingency_Identification and Results.m. The POWER_DATA_RESULTS_MLR attempts to do line failures identifiaction with SSARX MLR. POWER_DATA_RESULTS_N4SID attempts to do line failure identification with N4SID. Results.m tests various linear mode extraction techniques under noise. Residual_Contingency_Identification attempts to do line failure identification by comparing simiulated-noisy data residuals. 

To run the scripts, click run on the matlab editor tab. It provides computational data with regard to the various algorithms under noise.
